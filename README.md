# icold-2013

## Overview
This is a mirror for data that was provided in Theme C of the 12th International Benchmark Workshop on Numerical Analysis of Dams (ICOLD 2013).
The repository provides data concerning a hypothetical dam failure; it is intended to be used as a benchmark for flood simulation and consequence assessment tools.

## Results of the Workshop
Eight teams participated in the workshop.
[A summary of this workshop, comparing techniques and results, was communicated](http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-14-28984).
The Los Alamos National Laboratory team also [communicated their techniques and results in greater detail](http://www.tasseff.com/documents/workshops/2013-hydropolis_dam_failure_impact_assessments.pdf).

## Usage as a Benchmark
I recommend that this scenario be used as a standard case study for testing and comparing software that computes numerical estimates of flooding.
